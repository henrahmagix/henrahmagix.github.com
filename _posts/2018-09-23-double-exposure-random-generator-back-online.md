I've replaced [https://lorempixel.com](https://lorempixel.com) with [https://picsum.photos](https://picsum.photos), which serves with CORS headers so the browser will let us play with and display the images through JavaScript.

Please give it a go yourself [here](/doubles/random)!

My two favourite examples so far from using [https://picsum.photos](https://picsum.photos):

![randomly generated double exposure of a camera and architectural photo](/images/double-random-camera.jpg)
![randomly generated double exposure of clouds over a hill and someone's legs](/images/double-random-landscape-legs.jpg)
