A month or two ago, I decided to embark on listening to every song in my ‚≠êÔ∏èstarred‚≠êÔ∏è playlist from most recent to the very first.

I would be listening to it in the morning as I woke up; on my way into work; occasionally at work; occasionally on my way home; and sometimes just around the house in the evening.

Today, I have finally listened to the last (nay, _first_) song: the title track from the film [Oblivion](imdb.com/title/tt1483013/?ref_=ext_shr_tw_tt) by [M83](http://ilovem83.com/)! It features [Susanne Sundf√∏r](http://susannesundfor.com/), and you can listen to it [here](http://m83.it/oblivionostWe) (album link [here](http://ilovem83.com/music/oblivion-soundtrack/)). I added it on March 26th, 2014.

I actually found two other great songs with the same title on the same day, and they're both great!
- [Oblivion by Bastille](https://open.spotify.com/track/5iyqqccidB1SEpOXXctyTR?si=AMWp-EVdRL6SGjQyhKvMnQ), from the album [All This Bad Blood](https://www.bastillebastille.com/allthisbadblood/)
- [Oblivion by Grimes](https://open.spotify.com/track/2RtNSM8cPCAOZ5bvQbW6y3?si=dsBy7mBgRqy9z4OrXkTWbw), from the album Visions

I had an amazing time revisiting songs I hadn't listened to in a long time, and occasionally I would get strong visual memories of what I was doing at that time. There were also occasions that I would put a song on repeat because I loved it so much, and realised that I still do!
