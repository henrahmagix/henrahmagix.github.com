Writing paragraphs makes me feel good! This is the excerpt.

This example demonstrates code snippets:

```js
class Content {
    get title() {
        return 'cannot change';
    }
}
```
```js
const myContent = new Content();
alert(`My title = ${myContent.title}`);
```

In this small example, my point is useless. But when it comes to writing a complicated set of paragraphs, with footnotes[*](#footnote-1), I find the text to be much easier to edit: it points me directly to the footnote, whereas a failure should raise an error (good!) or just... make everything not work[**](#footnote-2).

A horizontal rule is always nice. And sometimes [a link][a-link "with a title"] with text after it.

<small id="footnote-1">* because you're just writing for fun, and you're allowed to make that decision because you're you, and the text doesn't matter really, right? _right?_ ðŸ™ƒ</small>

<small id="footnote-2">** and you spend half an hour thinking "why did I start this?", only to remember that you wanted to blog more, because your mind is a sponge of cool ideas, so you started writing that too, and now you've gotten it all out of your head, and you don't need to remember what you've done, you just know that _WRITING IS GOOD_</small>
