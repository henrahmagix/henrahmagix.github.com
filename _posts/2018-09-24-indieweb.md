title: IndieWeb is seriously cool
---

This weekend, the lovely and amazing [Garrett](https://polytechnic.co.uk/) put together an IndieWeb camp for two days, for free, in Oxford!

After hearing about it through Garrett a few months back, just before an amazing talk at [Oxford Geek Nights](http://oxford.geeknights.net/) by [Jeremy Keith](https://adactio.com/), I thought:

>This is cool, but... how... how does it???

## How does it though?

It just does. I mean, I'm really not a bastion of knowledge on anything, and frankly I don't know why you're reading this (unless you're here for the webmentions, in which case lets hug!), so I'm just going to say...

## FUN WAS HAD

[Haybrook IT](http://www.haybrook.co.uk/) _yet again_ amazingly sponsored the two-day camp, and [White October](https://www.whiteoctober.co.uk/) generously allowed us use of their offices, so we got to work whilst it was starting to rain.

I had kind of started getting Indieauth setup, so I didn't have much to do on that side apart from authenticate with a few providers and fix the `rel="me"` links on my site. Speaking of which, I took the opportunity to implement the new design I've had sitting in my inbox for the last 2-3 years, and you're looking at it!

## Webmentions?

I _think_ I have them setup. This post will let us know...

### Wall of Faces

This was a fab goal that many at the camp achieved (even when the second day was _kindasorta_ rained off) but I haven't touched on â€“ I spent the time figuring out the hAtom format for posting content, how [POSSE](https://indieweb.org/POSSE)/[PESOS](https://indieweb.org/PESOS) might be setup, and generally implementing this site's new design.

Oh! And [I got the DERG (Double Exposure Random Generator) back up and running!]({% post_url 2018-09-23-double-exposure-random-generator-back-online %})

I'm well chuffed with a weekend well spent with others =)
