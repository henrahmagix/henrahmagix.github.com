Help it become a useable module for others

Use data-editable="my-frontmatter-key" to match editable elements to frontmatter or content, then EditPost can be entirely generic: on load it queries all data-editable elements and, if logged in, allows editing.

Ask for image before publishing: confirm(add image?) then click a file input, hopefully that will open the file chooser immediately. Name the image the same as the filename (can it be the published filename?) Obvs only do this if it doesnâ€™t have an image yet

Add formatting buttons like wysiwyg editors, ul/ol, headings and such
