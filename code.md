All of my hobby code is [on GitHub]({{site.github.owner_url}}) <i class="{{site.data.links.code.icon}}" aria-hidden="true"></i>, including [this website]({{site.github.repository_url}}) and its features, like the [iPad cursor]({{site.github.repository_url}}/blob/{{site.github.build_revision}}/js/ipad-cursor.js).

Since all of the coding I've done for work is in private repositories, my commit history is pretty sparse! However, I've been working a tonne on this website, so feel free to view the history on GitHub.
